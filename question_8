Write a program that outputs today’s date and time in the format “Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm”.

import datetime
thisTime = datetime.datetime.now() # to provide the current time
today = datetime.date.today()  # to provide the current date
if today.day >= 4 and today.day <= 20:     # the nest if statement is to give the suffix to the date (eg 31st)
    sx = "th"
elif today.day >= 24 and today.day <= 30:
    sx = "th"
elif today.day == 2 or today.day == 22:
    sx = "nd"
elif today.day == 1 or today.day == 21 or today.day == 31:
    sx = "st"
else:
    sx = "rd"
print ("Today is "+str(today.strftime('%A, '))+(today.strftime('%B '))+str(today.day)+str(sx)+(today.strftime(' %Y '))+"at " +(thisTime.strftime('%I:%M%P').lstrip("0").replace(" 0", " ")))   #here the string is concatenated. the strftime method is used to format the time

#Research:
# My first attempts was to use strftime to print the current time 
#       from time import strftime
#       strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S")
#       output was 'Sat, 30 Mar 2019 10:54:39'
# Reviewed solutions in S/O. These pointed to datetime class and the datetime type.
# Datetime.day has all days in a month, so I will create a nested if statement to add a suffix
# Create a nested if statement to give a variable (sx)
# Had some issues in format and concatenation, S/O provided more guidance.
