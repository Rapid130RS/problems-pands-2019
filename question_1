Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the
sum of all numbers between one and that number.


response = int(input ("Please enter a positive integer: "))
average = 0
sum = 0
if response > 0:
    #print("This is a positive number")
    for num in range (0, response+1,1):
      sum = sum+num
    print (sum)
else:
    print("Negative number")
