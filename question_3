Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.
# This outputs all numbers between 1000 and 10000 that can be divided by 6, but not 12. 

#x =  6
#y = 12
#for i in range(1000, 10001):
#    if(i%y==0) and (i%x!=0)
#    print(i)

n = input("Enter Number to calculate sum")
n = int (n)
average = 0
sum = 0
for num in range(0,n+1,1):
    sum = sum+num
print("Sum of first ", n, "numbers is: ", sum )
