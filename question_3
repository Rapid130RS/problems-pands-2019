Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.
# This outputs all numbers between 1000 and 10000 that can be divided by 6, but not 12. 

x =  6
y = 12
for i in range(1000, 10001):       # sets the range
  if i % x == 0 and i % y != 0:    # use modulo to test if numbers in the range can be divided by x(6) but not y(12)
        print(i)
        
# Approach
# I set the variables x and y, then used a for statement to test what numbers in the range meet the criteria.
