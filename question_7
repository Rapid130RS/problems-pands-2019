Write a program that that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

# take a positive floating point number as input from the user,
# output it as an approximate sqrt 
import math  # math module is needed for the sqrt function 
from decimal import Decimal # decimal function for rounding
num = float(input("Please enter a floating point number: "))
print("The square root of ", num, " is ", round(math.sqrt(num),2))  

# Process:
# I began by understanding the math module and sqrt function.
# Obtaining a sqrt is straightforward, the format of the string output was an issue
# I reveiewed solutions on S/O, and used the number rounding fromat funtion.
# I had consdered testing if the user inputed a floating number, but this would lengthen the code.
