Write a program that that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

# take a positive floating point number as input from the user,
# output it as an approximate sqrt 
import math  # math module is needed for the sqrt function 
from decimal import Decimal # decimal function for rounding
num = float(input("Please enter a floating point number: "))
print("The square root of ", num, " is ", round(math.sqrt(num),2))
