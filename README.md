# problems-pands-2019

This assignment is my own work; I confirm that I adhered to the Quality Assurance Framework and Code of Student Conduct.

I primarly used stackoverflow and python libaries as a starting point.
Where I have drawn on S/O or other sources like YouTube, I have referenced them as comments at the end of each question.

I did not approach all questions in order, I began with 9 and worked back, based on knowledge of Java, this made more sense. 
Much, if not all of my approach is trial and error, my overall objective was to meet the minimum needed for each question with the simplest solution. Where for example there was room to confirm is users' inputs were valid, I did not do so in order to avoid unnecessary text.
