# Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T.

import datetime   #import the datetime module to use the date object
today = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()     #return the current local date and return the weekday as a number; Mon = 0 to Sun = 6. 
if today ==1 or today == 3:   # 1 and 3 represent Tuesday and Thursday 
   print("Yes - today begins with a T")   
else:
   print("No - today does not begin with a T")
  
# Approach
# I reviewed the python library, looking for some function that returned weekday
# date.weekday() returns an int value for day Mon=0 to Sun=6
# I created an else/if to output if today begins with a T.
