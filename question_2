# Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T.

import datetime   #import the datetime module to use the date object
today = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()     #return the current local date and return the weekday as a number; Mon = 0 to Sun = 6. 
if today == 6:    
   print("yes")
else:
   print("no")
    
# Approach
# I reviewed the python library, looking for some function that returned weekday
# date.weekday() returns an int value for day Mon=0 to Sun=6
# I created an else/if to output if today begins with a T.
