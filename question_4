Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

number = input ("Please enter a positive integer: ")
i = 0
while number > 1:

  try:
     val = int(number)
  #    print("Yes that is an integer.") 
  except ValueError:
     print("No, that is not an integer")
  if(val > 0):
      print("Yes that is positive ")
      while val > 1:
         if (val%2 == 0):
           print ("This is even")
          even = int(val/2)
          val = val+even
          print(even)
         elif (val%2 != 0):
          print ("This is odd")
           odd = int((val*3)+1)
          print(odd)
    break 
else:
    print("No, that is negative ")
