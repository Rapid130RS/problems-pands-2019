# Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

# This takes an input; if it is even, divide by 2, 
# if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
# print the output.

number = input ("Please enter a positive integer: ")
if (int(number)%2 == 0):  #check if its even
    even=(number)/2         #if even divide by 2 and print
    print(int(even))
else:
    odd=(int(number)*3)+1 #if odd multiply by 3 and add 1
    print(int(odd))        # print output
